		The Statistic Manager provides an Interface to preprocess 
		the StatisticData into the Aggregation-Definition Tables. 
		Normally a cron-job runs every night and preprocesses the StatisticData from the day before.
		But if a new AggregationDefinition was created and the StatisticData of the last days/weeks 
		shall be written into the AggregationTable then this Interface can be used.
	</para>
	<para>
		Parameters of the interface-call are an aggregation-definition-id and an xml-record, according to 
		the preprocessing-information-schema. The xml-record contains an element start-date and an element end-date. 
	</para>
	<para>
		The user that calls the interface has to have permissions to 
		write content for the scope of the given aggregation-definition. (see chapter ‘security concept’)
