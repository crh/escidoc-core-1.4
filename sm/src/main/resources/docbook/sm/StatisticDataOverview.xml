		The Statistic Manager provides an Interface to write statistic records. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Parameter of the interface-call is an xml-record, according to 
		the statistic-data-schema. The xml-record contains one or more elements
		'parameter' with an attribute 'name' 
		and a subelement 'stringvalue', 'decimalvalue' or 'datevalue'.
		This allows to be very flexible and write whatever data the caller wants to write.
	</para>
	<para>
		The user that calls the interface has to have permissions to 
		write content for the scope defined in 
		the statistic-data-xml. (see chapter ‘security concept’)		
	</para>
	<para>
		The statistic-record is written into 
		a database-table, further referenced as statistics-table.  
		Additionally the timestamp is written into 
		the statistics-table.
