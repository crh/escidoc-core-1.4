		The Statistic Manager Component provides an interface to generate 
		statistics out of a report-definition. The interface-call requires 
		an xml-structure according to report-parameters-schema containing 
		the report-definition-id and parameters that fill the placeholders 
		in the sql-statement of the report-definition.		
	</para>
	<para>
		The generated statistic-report is an xml-document according to the report-schema.
		The xml-document has one or more report-record-elements that each represent 
		one row of the result-set of the sql-statement that was executed.
		One report-record-element has one or more elements
		'parameter' with an attribute 'name' 
		and a subelement 'stringvalue', 'decimalvalue' or 'datevalue' that 
		represent the fields of one record of the result-set.
	</para>
	<para>
		The user that calls the interface has to have permissions to 
		see content of the statistic-scope defined in 
		the report-definition-xml. (see chapter ‘security concept’)		
	</para>
	<para>
		The request returns an xml according to the statistics-report-schema.
