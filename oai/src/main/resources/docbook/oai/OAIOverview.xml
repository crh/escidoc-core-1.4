					<para>In order to enable a selective harvesting the meta data of
						Items and Containers of eSciDoc repository via OAI-PMH
						[http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html],
						Escidoc repository can be divided into sets composed of released
						and withdrawn Items and Containers. A set is not static: a set membership is defined by
						a CQL-query to the eSciDoc search service http://host:port/srw/search/escidocoaipmh_all. 
						Therefore a set composition changes over time according to changes on Items and Containers
					    and release of new Items and Containers.
					</para>
					<para>
						A Set Definition
						represents a description of a set and
						contains its CQL-query. Escidoc
						OAI-Provider builds Escidoc sets for existing set definitions
						from results of their CQL-queries.
					</para>
					<para>
						There are services, which support creation, updating and
						retrieval of Set Definitions.
