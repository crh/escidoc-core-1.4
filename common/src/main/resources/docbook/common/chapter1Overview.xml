    <title>Application Programming Interfaces</title>

      <para>The services of the eSciDoc Infrastructure offer an application
      programming interface (API) which is based on the concept of Representational
      State Transfer (REST). It is a web-service protocol, which allows you
      invoking methods of services remotely in a language-independent manner.
      You work with resources and a restricted set of verbs (e.g., the verbs defined by HTTP).</para>

      <para>A second option is the Java Interface Connector, which is targeted at
      Java developers. This connector hides the networking layer between
      eSciDoc Infrastructure and the application completely and provides a
      true object-oriented programming interface. The Java Interface Connector is
      not part of the eSciDoc Infrastructure and may be downloaded separately
      from the eSciDoc website (http://www.escidoc.org/). It comes with its
      own documentation and is thus not covered in this document.</para>
